## Application requirements
- If u want those icons for the [Streamdeck](https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/stream-deck), it might be required.
- If u want those icons for the game and the streamdeck, i highly recoment the [Stream-Deck-Plugin](https://github.com/mhwlng/streamdeck-elite).
  This plugin enables the streamdeck to react to gamestates and uses your key-bindings. The game is also needed, by the way.
- If u want those icons for anything else, well than anything else is requred.

## How to use
Well, they are just Images...

## Application requirements
- If u want those Icons for the [Streamdeck](https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/stream-deck), it might be required.
- If u want those Icons for the Game and the Streamdeck, i highly recoment the [Stream-Deck-Plugin](https://github.com/mhwlng/streamdeck-elite).
  This Plugin enables the Streamdeck to react to gamestates and uses your Key-Bindings. The Game is also needed, by the way.
- If u want those Icons for anything else, well than anything else is requred.

## How to use
Well, they are just Images...
